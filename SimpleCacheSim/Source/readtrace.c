 * in format [IWRX] hex number where:
 * I means instruction reference (never modified)
 * W means data write (memory modified at that address)
 * R means data read (that address accessed but unchanged)
 * X exception, resulting in wait time of the given number of instructions
 *
 * terminates either on a line starting with # or on EOF
 * does not check contents
